This is a simple web portfolio application developed during an internship at Slash Mark. It was designed for the purpose of showcasing personal projects and achievements.

The portfolio page contains a brief introduction about the developer, followed by a section that lists their skills and proficiencies. Then, there is a portfolio section where the developer's projects are showcased. Each project card contains a title, a description, a live link, and a GitHub link.

Additionally, there is a "Contact Me" section where potential employers can get in touch with the developer. This section includes a form that collects the user's name, email address, and a message. Upon submission, the form sends an email to the developer with the provided details.

Please note that this is a simple, single-page web application with minimal styling. The goal of this project was to create a basic, functional portfolio site rather than a visually appealing one.

The application was developed using the following technologies:

HTML5 for structuring the webpage.
CSS3 for basic styling.
